			<h2>Hunting Under the Umber</h2>
			<p>I was hunting out under the umber<br />
				The wind in the trees filled my ears with their sighs<br />
				The dominion of humankind quiet in slumber<br />
				The moon on my back and the stars in my eyes</p>
			<p>I move through this life in the throes of reflection<br />
				my body a visage that i cannot see<br />
				to be lost from my home, it was not my election<br />
				their minds they are distant and muted to me</p>
			<p>I've a lover who's strong as a banyan<br />
				I've a lover with mind old and wise<br /> 
				I've a lover who drinks deep from life with abandon<br /> 
				And she looks deep with love at the cat in my eyes</p>    
			<p>Deep in the shadows, i found her in my Bhava<br />  
				Her breath it came even, her form in repose<br />
				She opened her eyes, touched me with her Alaya<br /> 
				Her paws crossed beneath her, warm cat in the snows</p>  
			<p>Her mind swept through me, a wind of perception<br />
				a low gentle purring, that echoed my own<br />
				as my dichotomistic mind silenced it’s question<br />
				the truth became certain, creation my home</p>
			<p>Now we’ll be walking out under my umber<br />
				The wind in our trees fill our ears with their sighs<br />
				The minds of our people caress like a lover<br />
				The stars on our backs and our moons in our eyes</p>
