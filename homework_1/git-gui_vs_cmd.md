Git GUI vs command line interfaces

I have a lot of practice with git, as I use it with vim in my daily work flow. When I started using computers in the early 80s,
the command line was all that was available, and I grew to appreciate it's power through it's simplicity. In the 90s i used Windows
along with everyone else, but I never took to it. I was elated when I discovered Linux distributions in 1997, in which my beloved
command line was front and center again.

As far as git goes (from the git go?) I use the command line of course. I know the command structure well, and I'm faster with a
keyboard than I am a mouse.  I use the Colemak keyboard layout to increase my speed, and i have git integrated nicely with my vim
editor set up, so that I don't even have to leave my editing session to commit changes and get feedback from the git server.
