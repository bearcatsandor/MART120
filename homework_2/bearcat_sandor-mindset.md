My mindset is critical to me and I have to monitor it constantly while I'm working on something. I suffer from
two types of ADHD, so I've had to find coping mechanisms.  I'm an aural learner, and I find that when I have music playing
I retain information more reliably, and it helps me focus. I also have to break work up into small chunks or else I'll be
too distracted and anxious to start, and once I get started I won't be able to stop.
