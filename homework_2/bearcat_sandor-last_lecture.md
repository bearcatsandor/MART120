I really enjoyed this video, enough so that it took me almost 2 hours to watch it, 
with all the notes I was taking. The messages that affected me the most were the ideas
that walls are challenges that teach us how much we want something, and the idea of fulfilling
childhood dreams as an adult, and how important that is. 

Did just that this week. I've been a martial artist off and on since I was 16, but my
dream has been to take a form called Fu Jow Pai since I was about 9. Commonly known as
Tiger Style Kung Fu, it's based on feline movements and strikes.
I've seen myself as bipedal cat for as long as I've had a sense of self-image (I refer to 
myself as a Pentadactyl Jaguarundi Erectus), but there hasn't been any training available
for thousands of miles. 

I've never given up hope that I might learn it someday, and COVID-19 has given me an opportunity.
While researching a master of the style, I found that his website offered remote learning for existing 
students. I wasn't an existing student, but I called him and made my impassioned case, taking the social risk
of telling him about my feline self-identity as my impetus for my passion to be one of his students.

I start training next week.
